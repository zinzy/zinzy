# Researcher-designer-facilitator writing in public.

Hey pal, I'm @zinzy, an IndieWeb enthusiast thinking aloud over on [zinzy.website](https://zinzy.website).

I manage UX at [Leeruniek](https://leeruniek.nl), and I build resonant queer spaces.

I like to learn by solving my own problems, especially when they exist on the internet. As a general word of advice with regards to everything you'll find in my Github: **here be dragons, henny**.
