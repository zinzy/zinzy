# Designer, facilitator, and linguist learning by solving her own problems
Hey pal, I'm @zinzy. I manage product and design at [Leeruniek](https://leeruniek.nl). When I'm not doing that, I enjoy maintaining a collection of notes about the things I learn, think, like, and wonder about, on my personal site [zinzy.website](https://zinzy.website).
