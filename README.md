# Hey internet friend, I'm Zinzy (she/they) 👋🏽

I'm currently a Senior UX Researcher and Designer at Geriedica, living and working in Amsterdam. I'm a fanboi for the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), and enjoy tinkering on independent web publishing in my spare time. I use my personal website as a method of sharing parts of myself, my hobbies, and my work for public use. 

I like to learn by solving my own problems, especially when they exist on the Internet. As a general word of advice with regards to everything you'll find in my Github: **here be dragons, henny**. This space contains all sorts of poorly-written, honky tonk, hot fixes.
